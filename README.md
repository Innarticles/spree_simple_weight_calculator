Spree Simple Weight Calculator
==============================

Includes some shipping costs calculator for Spree Commerce.

SimpleWeight
============
It's based on the total weight of the package.
You simply specify a weight/price table in the textarea like this:

```
5:10
10.5:15
100:50.5
```

This means:
- up to 5kg cost is 10
- up to 10.5kg cost is 15
- up to 100kg cost is 50.5
- over 100kg this shipping method doesn't apply

An optional handling fee can also be added.

ItemWeight
==========
Similar to `SimpleWeight`, but shipping cost is calculated on *each single item* of the package, and them summed up.
Useful if each item is shipped in different pack.


Usage
=====

Add to your Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'spree_simple_weight_calculator', github: 'freego/spree_simple_weight_calculator',
                                      branch: '2-2-stable'
```

Create a shipping method from the admin interface and choose the right calculator.

Testing
-------

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake test_app
    $ bundle exec rspec spec
